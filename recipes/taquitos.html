        <p class="desc"><strong>Make taquitos, or rolled tacos, at home with this super easy recipe</strong> that uses canned or rotisserie chicken, cheese, and hot pepper sauce.
            <emp>The filling is easy to adjust — add sliced jalapeños if you prefer lots of heat</emp>. Bake until crisp and serve as an appetizer or 
            side dish with your favorite salsa. You can also serve them as a main course topped with lettuce, tomato, olives, sour cream, and more.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can chicken chunks, drained or 1 1/4 cups rotisserie chicken, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>5 drops hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco), or more to taste</li>
            <li>12 corn tortillas</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine chicken and cheese in a bowl; stir in hot pepper sauce to taste.</li>
            <li>Warm tortillas one at a time in a skillet over medium heat until flexible, about 10 seconds per side.</li>
            <li>Spread about 1 heaping tablespoonful of chicken mixture over half of a warmed tortilla. 
                Roll tightly to form a taquito starting at the filled side of the tortilla. 
                Place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden crisp and to your liking, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
